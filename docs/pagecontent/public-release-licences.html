    <h2>How we develop and release</h2>

    <p>
        Some applications developed for <a href="https://Fated.Quest">Fated.Quest</a>
        are to be publicly available for anyone to download or redistribute as they see fit.
        Public over private development requires a certain
        level of process which must be followed to ensure that public code is always secure and safe.
        If an application is distributed publicly this puts an onus on us to ensure quality control.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Before a public release (even a beta) the repo is private to ensure nobody downloads broken code</li>
        <li>
            During a public release development takes place on separate branches and is merged into the main branch
            <ul>
                <li>The exception being code which is developed a private and moved to a public for security reasons</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All public releases go through our QA program before an actual release is made</li>
    </ol>

        <strong>
            We must also comply with any external partners within our readme and provide setup assistance as per our guides.
        </strong>

    <h2>Development and Engagement</h2>

    <p>
        Development uses a ticket system which relate to the commits. Each development feature and release
        requires a branch. It is largely up to the team and developer for the branch layout (each project is
        different) so long as live does not occur on main.
    </p>

    <p>
        All commits to main must be:
        <ol>
            <li>Internally tested and QA Tested - use the testing process to ensure the release is safe</li>
            <li>Change Listed - Use the change list standard to update the documentation and keep everything  neat</li>
            <li>
                Released built - Follow-up commits to main by a release built where appropriate (packaged)
                to allow people to download the latest version
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Engagement on project takes place via the ticket system for bugs and tasks.
        For public external requests these should be triaged with project leaders and taken into account
        the internal use of the development.
    </p>

    <p>
        All engagements but especially public engagements must be:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Professional - speak in a professional manner at all times as you
                are representing the <a href="https://Fated.Quest">Fated.Quest</a> brand</li>
            <li>Helpful - where possible helpful even if you donâ€™t know attempt to point them in the right direction</li>
            <li>
                Actionable - provided the ticket is not spam, there should be some method to resolve the ticket and
                therefore a pending action placed to resolve it.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
