    </header>

    <h2>Specification</h2>

    <p>
        Prior to development on a project specification are outlined with the customer.
        Specification are the requirements for the final product and are front facing features.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the user interacts with the project via a user interface,
        specification should be given in the sense of the user interface.
        If the project is simply middleware or purely technical the specification maybe technical
        however specified by how third parties interact with the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifications make up the first section of the technical
        design document and should be agreed upon by the custom.
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>
        Projects require a design and a plan. For micro features this plan may be a sentence or two.
        For most features and certainly for new projects, the design should contain how the
        system works from a user and technical perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        Critically the design process should validate why certain choices are made ‚Äì
        otherwise these are points which should be pointed out upon peer review.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design should contain tasks, estimation, HCI and potentially UML.
        Technical design documents should be peer reviewed and the customer
        should sign off on the non-technical aspects.
    </p>

    <h2>Develop</h2>

    <p>
        Development takes place under certain disciplines.
        Software disciplines keep development under control and help us achieve our ethical professional aim.
        Coding standards and practices are in place for each environment.
        Test driven development is used where available.
    </p>

    <p>
        A key aspect of this process is to keep stakeholders informed of the development process and its state.
        They are the customers, and the development should involve them not simply arrive completed.
    </p>

    <h2>Test</h2>

    <p>
        Testing takes place during development as per our Agile workflow. Test driven development (where available)
        occurs in line with development. QA testing should occur when there is a front facing feature, ‚Äòfront facing‚Äô
        meaning an element the user may interact with (see QA & Beta testing).
    </p>

    <p>
        Self-testing and TDD occurs during the development and are the minimum.
        QA/Beta testing should occur before any public deployment,
        and it is the best judgement of the developer/peers if beta testing is a success.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beta tests may go ‚Äòpublic‚Äô in a separate release chain as part of
        deployment and feedback is taken as part of a future iteration.
        We should always plan for changes from testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Deploy</h2>

    <p>
        At the end of a given Sprint the development is deployable. It may not be public,
        and it may not have ‚Äòfront facing‚Äô features, for instance it might have the ability
        to provide the information to the user without hooking up to the user interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even without a front facing interaction, it should be deployable and separate branches /
        releases should be created. It is important to allow review to take place
        and to continually improve the code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Deployment occurs by project, everyone‚Äôs complete (non-breaking) changes are deployed,
        and this continues until the final release.
    </p>

    <h2>Review</h2>

    <p>
        At the end of a Sprint/development cycle a review takes place. A review involves reflection of what went well,
        what did not go well and importantly attempting to put into place measures to retain the elements
        which went well and avoiding the negative elements repeating.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this stage further work is taken on provided the project is not complete.
        The capacity is adjusted based on the capacity met during the previous sprints.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reviews are peer driven if the project is among many people.
    </p>

    <h2>Repeat or Live</h2>

    <p>
        A project is either considered not complete, in which further work is required for a first public release, or
        it is now public and live. In both situations the development cycle repeats until it is feature complete
        or to continue to deliver support to out user. During live, there maybe no work this is expected.
    </p>

    <p>
        Live support requires engagement from the community and continual fixes and features
        improvements as the team see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        A project may also be ‚Äògraveyard‚Äô and no longer supported this breaks the
        development cycle for a given project.

        NOTE: A given sprint may shorten if a project is solo and all work is complete.
        Not all the projects taken on are the same scale and size, therefore although these are steps,
        the timescales may vary greatly.
