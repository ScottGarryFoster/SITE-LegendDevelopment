        <h1>Research - Text Adventure Games</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
        This is the research into the genre expected for the product and games of the same genre.
        This is a living document and may be added to as the concept is formed.

    <p>
        There are many modern text adventure games. These are developed using HTML (presumably Javascript)
        and software which offer TA out of the box. The options there appear to be
        <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a>,
        <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/quest">Quest</a> and
        <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy">Squiffy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Existing software and what the designers may do out of the box</h3>

    <p>
        It is worth diving into the software to create TA as generally it appears that out of the box software
        is used on distribution platforms such as
        <a href="https://textadventures.co.uk" target="_blank">TextAdventures.co.uk</a>.
        The software is limited and although
        one might be able to implement certain features others would be rather difficult.
    </p>

    <h3>Squiffy and Twine</h3>

    <p>
        These engines work via passages and linking them together.
        It entirely relies on clicking and you may store some attributes for flags. It is more akin to
        adventure books to full text adventure worlds.

    <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th><img src="images/page-content/gd-c-research/squiffy.JPG"
                         alt="Squiffy text adventure engine."></th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Squiffy text adventure engine.
                    <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy"

            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <h3>Quest</h3>

    <p>
        This appear rather popular it they offers out of the box inventory, location and context clues within the text.
        With Quest one also literally types into the chat although this is simply an option. Clicking on context
        items may be done in quest and options when clicking on contexts may be done also.
    </p>

    <p>
        The map in quest is also contextual in that the size of rooms and how they connect may be shown to the
        player to give a sense of size and how the world fits together. There is still a large amount of piecing
        together the world from larger areas to small as rarely will a basic map do such for a 1 to 1 map.

    <h3>RPG Text Adventures</h3>

    <p>
        On mobile there are attempts to mix texture adventure and elements of role-playing games.
        These feature full inventories, stats, and battle systems. Arguably Knights of Pen and Paper
        is also a text adventure in this vein except with visuals.
    </p>

    <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <a href="images/page-content/gd-c-research/path-of-adventure-1.jpg"
                       target="_blank">
                    <img src="images/page-content/gd-c-research/path-of-adventure-1.jpg"
                         alt="Path of Adventure, Fighting system in a text adventure." width="50%" />
                    </a>
                </th>
                <th>
                    <a href="images/page-content/gd-c-research/path-of-adventure-2.jpg"
                       target="_blank">
                    <img src="images/page-content/gd-c-research/path-of-adventure-2.jpg"
                         alt="Path of Adventure, Fighting system in a text adventure." width="50%" />
                    </a>
                </th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">
                    Path of Adventure.
                    <a href="https://www.pathofadventure.com/"
                       target="_blank">Source</a>.
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>
        The choices made in the battle system are not actual text adventure style choices in a puzzle solving sense.
        Instead, the options are presented as the stats and actions taken by the opponent along with the player’s
        options. The reason this isn’t quite an open-ended text adventure is the options are rather monotone (use)
        and the options rather limited, making it seem less like a TA and more like playing against a deck of cards.
    </p>

                    </a>
                </th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">
                    Path of Adventure.
                    <a href="https://www.pathofadventure.com/"

                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>
        Inventory and stats are kept throughout the game with shops in the world to acquire items.
        These are the elements of role-playing games. There is no real conversation with the shopkeeper
        though nor any opportunity to stumble into money via hidden options in the dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experience itself is largely like that of the other engines without the need for typing as this is a
        mobile device. In this game the options in the text are not clickable only the explicit options at the bottom.
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay and considerations</h3>

    <h4>What are the actions?</h4>

    <p>
        Text adventure games which require the player to type appear to have a glaring problem.
        This is that 90% of the commands entered will not be interpreted correctly by the engine in
        question. This might not even be because the engine cannot perform the task but more because
        the method typed is not parse-able by the machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take for instance, the action of seeing what the area contains. This action may have several commands to type,
        look around, observe surroundings, see room, look for interesting things. These all need to not only accounted
        for but also the player should know what they can and cannot type. The problem is that not only could a single
        incorrect word out of place mean a miss-interpretation but that the player may incorrectly believe that what
        they are proposing is impossible when the words they are typing are simply incorrect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly it is worth noting that a single miss-spelling in this may also lead the player to believe this also.
        Miss-spellings with single letters, or common letters which switch places (e and a in English for instance)
        would also give this effect. This should be something considered there is likely a way to fix this issue
        for the player.
    </p>

    <h4>What are my abilities?</h4>

    <p>
        This is something learned by doing, which is certainly preferable to being told.
        The gameplay has the player attempt things and then the engine either tells them no or
        kills them as a method of teaching. This is a practice seen in modern video games
        (dark souls, modern Zelda etc).
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a concern with some of these abilities that there is an overlap with actions in that knowing
        one’s abilities is a lot like knowing one’s actions.
    </p>

    <h4>What is my goal?</h4>

    <p>
        Getting across a clear goal in text adventure games appears at odds with the genres which came after it.
        The TA methods are to add a score for the number of correct actions and the goal is to complete narrative.
        The over arching hero’s story is not truly expressed in a real sense and this unfortunately leads to
        progressing for progression’s sake.
