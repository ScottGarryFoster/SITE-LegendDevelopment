        <h1>Ethics</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
        Software is important. The software we make with <a href="https://fated.quest" target="_blank">Fated.Quest</a>
        may run on our customer's computers,
        our Linux servers and interact with users data. This level of power grants the software great
        power and with great power comes great responsibility.
        <a href="https://fated.quest" target="_blank">Fated.Quest</a> developers uphold a set of
        basic ethical principles with our development to ensure our software is developed ethically
        and that we act professionally. These are ethics in terms of ‘work ethics’ and professional
        ethics to ensure our code is of a particular standard, we work to a particular expectation
        and that our development is ethical to our customers / colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are largely borrowed from a veteran in the software industry
        Robert Martin (Clean Coder) which you can

    <h2>1. Only quality is shipped</h2>

    <p>
        Software maybe an unknown beast at times however ethically speaking when it comes to releasing code
        to the public, all of it should to the best of the developers knowledge be quality code.
        We will not ship junk and we do not test junk code on live servers first - test on safe servers first.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Continuous Improvement</h2>

    <p>
        As changes are made to an existing system or to replace an existing system it is expected that the result is
        improvement. We do not expect that changes to a given system results in regression or loss of features in a
        given area. This should be applicable throughout and with third party libraries this maybe unavoidable
        (with their support loss) however internally there is no reason for our internal development to not
        continually improve.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Inexpensive adaptability</h2>

    <p>
        When making changes, new features or new products the cost (time) associated with these changes is
        proportional to the request. It is expected that upon a message in a command changing this cost
        might be quite small and that adding a plugin to record every block placed outputting to a file
        would become larger. In large systems however it may become the case that changes which appear
        small may estimate large and this is a product of bad architecture. When developing software
        one must consider how it might be changed and altered to ensure that future changes are
        proportional to request.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Solve problems don’t create them</h2>

    <p>
        In anything deployed on our servers or released, the reasoning behind the feature should be examined to be
        solving a particular problem and not indirectly creating one. Creating problems is not an element of
        development one generally does on purpose, it is expected developers do not intentionally create direct
        problems however it is also expected that developers examine their changes beyond direct implications
        to ensure that there are no indirect problems caused by their code.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, stopping players from entering a district in the game until a flag is set may be approached
        in several ways some of which create problems such as checking the player’s location every second to
        remove them.  Changes to existing features
        may lead to problems or issues which are avoidable if the issue is well-thought-out or simply
        not completed due to integrity.
    </p>

    <h2>5. We will not dump on QA</h2>

    <p>
        Quality assurance and in this context the alpha and beta testers at large,
        are a part of the development process to help avoid buggy code reaching the
        production servers (in a dangerous state) or the public. QA are not a replacement
        for testing code nor should they actually find anything except perhaps cosmetic
        changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ideally we should get as much advice on cosmetic, functional and overall changes as possible to avoid this.
        When developing and before QA thorough testing should take place to ensure anything which is picked up is
        unexpected by the developers.
