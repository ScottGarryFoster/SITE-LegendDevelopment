    <p>
        These are some useful applications for development with git. Some of these are optional and some of
        these are nice to have even if others perform the same task.
    </p>

    <h2>GitHub Desktop</h2>

    <p>
        Some of our code is written outside an
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide" target="_blank">IDE</a>
        with a built-in method to commit our code.
        Additionally, GitHub desktop is a fairly user-friendly interface to manage a repository from a
        top level or quickly gain access to the bash command line if needed. It is useful even if it is
        used infrequently as the majority of us use Windows and do not touch the command line
        (nor do we need to 99% of the time).
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a tutorial on how to get setup on GitHub desktop for that see
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop" target="_blank">this</a>,
        however you should get familiar with creating repositories, cloning repositories,
        creating branches, committing, merging branches with main and pull requests.
        The later may be found in that guide or on
        <a href="git-and-development.html"
           target="_blank">Git and Development</a>
        as other <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide" target="_blank">IDE</a>
        which use Git are essentially just GUI for the same Git repositories.

    <h2>Atom</h2>

    <p>
        Atom is optional but preferred. When it comes to merge conflicts there may come a time when
        Git has no idea what exactly to do with your commit. Atom lays out the merge conflict in
        a nicer way than the ‘out of the box’ method provided by Github Desktop. It is free and
        <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">found here</a>.
        Once installed restart GitHub desktop, File → Options and then select Atom as the external editor.

    <h2>Notepad++</h2>

    <p>
        High on the list simply due to how versatile this application is, notepad++ allows for syntax
        highlighting and coding like features within a text editor. It is free and maybe
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="_blank">found here</a>.

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2>Rider</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank">Rider</a>
        is an alternative editor to visual studio and used for our Unity and C# tools development.
        The main advantages (for our purposes) are the optimisations when building (and managing) projects,
        better test-driven development, advanced syntax suggestions, git management and collaboration tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank">Rider</a>
        does not have a community edition, instead the licence must be acquired from Jet Brains.
    </p>
