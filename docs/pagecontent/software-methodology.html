        <h1>Software Methodology</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
        Methodologies are a plan to manage a given project and software methodologies are plans used in software.
        Occasionally when searching online the term ‚ÄòDevelopment Life Cycle‚Äô will appear almost pseudonymously,
        this is because Software Development Life Cycles describe how software is developed and a methodology
        (or model) is then a plan to follow during this life cycle
        (<a href="https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sdlc-and-vs-agile-methodology/"
           target="_blank">see this</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        For any long term project <a href="https://Fated.Quest">Fated.Quest</a>
        follows an Agile Methodology using a hybrid of the technology of sprints
        without scrums (due to the small team sizes). Agile describes moving through each of the stages as is
        needed during sprints (generally 1-3 weeks). In the best case scenario the stages take place one after
        another during a single deployment however there are no limitations. At the end of a given sprint an
        artefact is produced which is ‚Äúdeployable‚Äù, it likely will not contain every feature however it should
        contain more than the last deployment. This cycle repeats until the deployment meets the specifications
        at the start of the project.

    <p>
        <a href="https://Fated.Quest">Fated.Quest</a> follows Agile by splitting any large project into tasks
        (including bugs) and creating tickets for each
        (this should be followed on live projects also). Each ticket maybe a sentence or two for a task
        (or a reproduction for a bug) and ideally contain an estimation. Just before a sprint
        (or before work is taken on) tasks are allocated and work may commence. For live projects sprints may
        not be used for each project and tickets picked up as part of the ‚Äòscript‚Äô capacity for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of each sprint there is something to deploy, this may not be publicly releasable but should be
        testable and uploaded. Further tasks are picked up and the tasks are completed until public or private release.

        Agile does not make you faster, no SDLC does, Agile is a SDLC which may indicate whether
        there is an issue in your workflow sooner.

    <h2>Why Agile?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Agile allows for a rapid fluid development cycle</li>
        <li>Constant review of all stages of the work instead of longer planning/design/development times</li>
    </ul>
