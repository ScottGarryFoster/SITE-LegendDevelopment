    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>
        <b>In one sentence describe the purpose of this project.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Now describe the purpose in more words without going into specifics of values or numbers,
        just the overall purpose and reason we are doing this work.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Front Facing Features</h2>

    <p><b>
        How the feature (if any) is to interact or be interacted with from the outside world.
        As a plugin or command this is the UX/UI of that. As purely technical how something would technically plugin to this.

    <h2>Technical Design</h2>

    <p><b>
        Go into the literal technical design. Use UML where it helps. You do not need to go too in depth,
        for instance the exact methods you write - this is design not implementation.
        Therefore, just public facing design is required.

    <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>

    <p><b>
        How is data passed in and out of this?
        Is there any significant data passed around which might be able to be used by external plugins?
        This is also a good point for configuration files.
