    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>
        <b>In one sentence describe the purpose of this project.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Now describe the purpose in more words without going into specifics of values or numbers,
        just the overall purpose and reason we are doing this work.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Key Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        <b>A list of requirements to hit for this to be complete.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Front Facing Features</h2>

    <p><b>
        How the feature (if any) is to interact or be interacted with from the outside world.
        As a plugin or command this is the UX/UI of that. As purely technical how something would technically plugin to this.

    <h2>Technical Design</h2>

    <p><b>
        Go into the literal technical design. Use UML where it helps. You do not need to go too in depth,
        for instance the exact methods you write - this is design not implementation.
        Therefore, just public facing design is required.

    <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>

    <p><b>
        How is data passed in and out of this?
        Is there any significant data passed around which might be able to be used by external plugins?
        This is also a good point for configuration files.

        What are the risks to this project. How might this fail, how might the estimations be too short.

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p><b>
        List the tasks by name, in order, with descriptions and with estimations.
        Tasks should be releasable.
        So do not write “Data can be saved” “Data can be loaded” instead “Persistent data between restarts”.
        Each should build up to a testable user story however
        you may break down the tasks further to create better estimations.

    <h2>Test Plan</h2>
    <p><b>
        What is the test plan.
        In terms of unit/integration testing what might be a good line of classes
        you’d like to integration test? In terms of top down,
        what QA level testing would you like to see.
    </b></p>

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2>Feedback Plan</h2>
    <p><b>
        Given these are public facing what is the feedback plan,
        do you seek this via a channel in Discord? Are we doing this for a week, month?
        Is this a private beta as we go with customers?
