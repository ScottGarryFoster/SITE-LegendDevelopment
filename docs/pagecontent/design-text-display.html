        Informs the user about the world, actions, and story via the medium of characters on a screen. Lays out the text in such a way that any action may be given and for custom characters.

    <h2>Why</h2>

    <p>
        The game is a text adventure, so text display is a key element of this. It allows full customisation of characters, how the display and how interactions take place. The flexibility to full customise anything mean that future design may take advantage of these systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        A higher flexibility with this text display means better future designs and better story telling which are the backbone of the genre.
    </p>

    <p>
        A monospaced font portrays two key elements, retro gaming with text adventures and allows for ASCII art as using a set spacing mean vertical lines are possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Animations will become useful with a battle system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Music and event queues will become useful to bring people into the experience and needs to be in this stage as text speed is customisable therefore it should be tied to this system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Custom characters allow us to draw characters on the screen for a battle system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pausing mid-sentence should allow for the storyteller to keep information away from the player and build suspense.
    </p>

    <h2>Background Research</h2>

    <p>
        Other text adventures such as the ones produced through TextAdventures.com using Quest and Squiffy use a column of text to portray information to the user. The left and right margins should allow for future implementations of inventory, map, and battle systems these engines also use.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking on items in the text is a key element of Quest, Squiffy and Twine which is a reason for that option in our engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        The text entry is found within Quest and allows for a broader window from the player into the game. This is found in older adventure games such as Zork.
    </p>

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2>Considerations</h2>

    <h3>Game Rating</h3>

    <p>
        Text display itself does not have the ability to raise the rating depending on the custom characters. The ratings are based on content more than systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Patents, Trademarks and Copyright</h3>

    <p>
        This likely does not overlap with or qualify for a patent as it is essentially a word processor.
    </p>

    <h3>Build and Systems</h3>

    <p>
        Taking the characters and text would become a build process from the tools. This would need to be within the game executable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rendering the element on screen would be a required system.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools</h3>

    <p>
        There needs to be a tool to create characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        When eventually the input for text system is created a tool should be created for this which allows for text with these elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Save file implications</h3>

    <p>
        The state of the screen would need to be included in the save file with loading included.
    </p>

    <h3>Performance Implications</h3>

    <p>
        This would increase the performance requirements but not by much. It is just a word processor, but the implementation is likely to be such to use images. This is likely to increase the performance therefore but not by much and is likely a necessity.
    </p>

    <h3>Effect on other systems</h3>

    <p>
        This would be the system a lot of other systems interact with. As the output to the user the economy, battle and map systems will all interact with this.
    </p>

    <p>
        This therefore needs to be compatible with other systems and be flexible enough for those systems.
